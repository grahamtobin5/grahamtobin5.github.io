**About me:** Hello, my name is Graham Tobin. I am a junior at Appalachian State. I was born and raised in Hillsborough, North Carolina (a small town outside of Chapel Hill). One of the main reasons I chose to come to Boone for college is because my sister got got her bachelors degree here, and also because I love the mountains. I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science with aspirations to become a Software Developer. My hobbies include hiking with my dog, hanging out with friends, and snowboarding.
