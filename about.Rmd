Hello, my name is Graham Tobin. I am a junior at Appalachian State. I was born and raised in Hillsborough, North Carolina (a small town outside of Chapel Hill). My sister got her bachelors of education from Appalachian State, which is one of the main reasons I chose to come to Boone (I also love the mountains). I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science with aspirations to become a Software Developer. My hobbies include hiking with my dog, hanging out with friends, and snowboarding.
